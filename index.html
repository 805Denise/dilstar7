      <p class="copy">Action Jackson (otherwise known as The Notorious Poo-face) was born on the ocean-facing coastal slopes of the Santa Ynez mountains and lived with his mama mountain lion and sibblings until 10 weeks of age, at which time, he departed the mountains to live at Elbertollenne Farms with the two aforementioned black dogs, Alice Agnes and Judith Anne. Over a period of the next four years, Jack, Judy and Alice lived an unevental but contented life in the quiet central California coastal town, Noleta.</p>
