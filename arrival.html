      <div class="story">Seeking the most up-to-date advise from the Interplanetary Travelers Group International, Dilstar7 explores the airspace approximately 3 feet in front of her eyes to perceive their potential prescence. Interplanetary travel advisors automatically appear
        about 3 feet in front of the retinal plane of any intelligent life form actively contemplating interplanetary travel. If travel contemplated is inter-solar, a separate set of advisors is available at a distance of approximately 20 feet in front of the retinal
        plane. Dilstar7 is clearly seeking the presence of "interplanetary" advisors as evidenced by the "wide-open" posture of her eyes. Intelligent beings focusing 20 feet ahead of the retinal plane have a far more relaxed  expression that can be described as "soft-eyed," or even "squinty-eyed" as they relax and focus on objects not directly before them.

      <div class="storytitle">Why do we say, "The Sewing Machine?"</div>
      <div class="story">Many fans of this blog and those persuing sources of data and narrative on the "Dilstar7-Phenom" wonder why the language "The Sewing Machine" so frequently appears in documents, Dilstar7 spreadsheets, archives and paranormal accounts related to her mysterious origins story. The language "The Sewing Machine", which most recently appeared in dialog and oral accounts cited in the current  Amazon best-selling bibliography <i>The Unauthorized Dilstar7 History</i>, is actually the code name of her  "Ideal" interplanetary traveling companion, Sunny-Betty (aka "Dinky-Doodle"). Sunny-Betty, aka "dinky-Doodle", aka "The Sewing Machine" is actually a contract emloyee who lives and works alongside Dilstar7 at Elbertollenne Farms in Noleta, California. Sunny-Betty has held several key positions at Elbertollenne Farms, including food service manager, activity director
