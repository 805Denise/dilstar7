        <div class="story">Seeking the most up-to-date advise from the Interplanetary Travelers Group International, Dilstar7 explores the airspace approximately 3 feet in front of her eyes to perceive their potential prescence. Interplanetary travel advisors are automatically about 3 feet in front of the retinal plane of any intelligent life form contemplating interplanetary travel. If travel contemplated is inter-solar, a separate set of advisors is available at  a distance of at least 20 feet in front of the retinal plane. Dilstar7 is clearly seeking the presence of "interplanetary" advisors as evidenced by the "wide-open" posture of her eyes. Intelligent beings focusing 20 feet ahead of the retinal plane have much more relaxed forehead muscles and an expression that can be described as "soft-eyed," or even "squinty-eyed" as they relax and focus on an object not directly before them.

        <div class="story">Many fans of this blog and those persuing sources of data and narrative on the "Dilstar7-Phenom" wonder why the language "The Sewing Machine" so frequently appears in documents, Dilstar7 spreadsheets, archives and paranormal accounts related to her as a phenom.
