      <div class="story">
        <p>Seeking the most up-to-date advice from the Interplanetary Travelers Advisory Group, Dilstar7 explores the "seemingingly" empty airspace approximately 3 feet in front of her face in an attempt to perceive their potential prescence. Interplanetary travel advisors automatically appear about 3 feet in front of the retinal plane of any intelligent life form actively contemplating interplanetary travel and seeking the to make contact with official interplanetary travel guides. Dilstar7 is clearly seeking the presence of "interplanetary" advisors as evidenced by the "wide-open" extreme posture of her eyes.</p>

        <p>(Editors Note: If travel contemplated is inter-galactic, a separate set of advisors is available at a distance of approximately 20 feet in front of the retinal plane.)</p>

      <div class="story">
        <p>In the video footage below, Dilstar7 is trained to battle off unwanted, imposter interplanetary traveler advisors by her associates The Notorious Pooh-Face and Judith Anne Sollenne. Early in Dilstar7's career at Elbertonllenne farms, coinciding with a peek meteor season and intense electro-magnetic solar activity, a high volume of imposter interplanetary travel advisor apparitions were reported between the coastal towns of Port Hueneme, California, and Vandenberg Airforce Base, just south of Calpoly Technical Institute in San Luis Obispo. Little wonder Judith Anne and Notorious Pooh-Face felt is so necessary to begin martial arts training for Dilstar7 at such a young age.</p>

      <div class="storytitle">Why do we say, "The Sewing Machine?"</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Many fans of this blog and those persuing sources of data and narrative on the "Dilstar7-Phenom" wonder why the language "The Sewing Machine" so frequently appears in documents, Dilstar7 spreadsheets, archives and paranormal accounts related to her mysterious origins story.</p>

        <p>The language "The Sewing Machine", which most recently appeared in dialog and oral accounts cited in the current  Amazon best-selling bibliography <i>The Unauthorized Dilstar7 History</i>, is actually the code name of her  "Ideal" interplanetary traveling companion, Sunny-Betty (aka "Dinky-Doodle").</p>

        <p>Sunny-Betty, aka "dinky-Doodle", aka "The Sewing Machine" is actually a contract emloyee who lives and works alongside Dilstar7 at Elbertollenne Farms in Noleta, California. Sunny-Betty has held several key positions at Elbertollenne Farms, including Food Service Manager, and  Activity Director.</p>

      <div class="story">
        <p>In a desperate attempt to destroy a potentially damning communication, The_Notorious_Pooh-Face viciously attacks a napkin containing "manipulated" evidence — a series of dot-like ink transfers from a source unknown but clearly "interplanetary".</p>

        <p>It is not uncommon for interplanetary instructions to be transmitted in covert fashion — napkin stains, mud spots on clothing, dirty dishes and filth on automobiles. This highly deceptive practive of camoflaging code into ordinary "stain" patterns has been highly advanced by Dilstar7 and the Interplanetary Travel Advisors.</p>

        <p>DO NOT BE FOOLED. Every pattern is evidence. Every splatter is potentialy a communication from the Interplanetary Travel Advisors. The Notorious Pooh-Face attempts to intercept a powerful communication from the IPA (Interplanetary Travel Advisors) but as readers will learn in upcoming blogs, this attempt to halt intervention will prove unsuccessful.</p>
