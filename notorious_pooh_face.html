      <div class="storytitle">In Desparation, Dilstar7 seeks rare & precious Inter-Planetary Travel Advisory Document</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Seeking the most up-to-date advise from the Interplanetary Travelers Group International, Dilstar7 explores the airspace approximately 3 feet in front of her eyes to perceive their potential prescence. Interplanetary travel advisors automatically appear
        about 3 feet in front of the retinal plane of any intelligent life form actively contemplating interplanetary travel.</p>

        <p>If travel contemplated is inter-solar, a separate set of advisors is available at a distance of approximately 20 feet in front of the retinal plane.</p>

        <p>Dilstar7 is clearly seeking the presence of "interplanetary" advisors as evidenced by the "wide-open" posture of her eyes in this early video of her arrival as as a "pup" at Elbertollenne Farms. Intelligent beings focusing 20 feet ahead of the retinal plane have a far more relaxed  expression that can be described as "soft-eyed," or even "squinty-eyed" as they relax and focus on objects not directly before them.</p>

      <p>In the video footage below, Dilstar7 is trained to battle off unwanted interplanetary traveler advisors by her associates The_Notorious_Pooh_Face and Judith Anne Sollenne.</p>

      <div class="storytitle">Why do we say, "The Sewing Machine?"</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Many fans of this blog and those persuing sources of data and narrative on the "Dilstar7-Phenom" wonder why the language "The Sewing Machine" so frequently appears in documents, Dilstar7 spreadsheets, archives and paranormal accounts related to her mysterious origins story.</p>

        <p>The language "The Sewing Machine", which most recently appeared in dialog and oral accounts cited in the current  Amazon best-selling bibliography <i>The Unauthorized Dilstar7 History</i>, is actually the code name of her  "Ideal" interplanetary traveling companion, Sunny-Betty (aka "Dinky-Doodle").</p>

        <p>Sunny-Betty, aka "dinky-Doodle", aka "The Sewing Machine" is actually a contract emloyee who lives and works alongside Dilstar7 at Elbertollenne Farms in Noleta, California. Sunny-Betty has held several key positions at Elbertollenne Farms, including food service manager, and  activity director.</p>

      <div class="storytitle"> "Notorious_Pooh-Face" foolhardily attempts "shred"-ation of Planetary Travel Code</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>In a desperate attempt to destroy a potentially damning communication, The_Notorious_Pooh-Face viciously attacks a napkin containing "manipulated" evidence — a series of dot-like ink transfers from a source unknown but clearly "interplanetary".</p>

        <p>It is not uncommon for interplanetary instructions to be transmitted in covert fashion — napkin stains, mud spots on clothing, dirty dishes and filth on automobiles. This highly deceptive practive of camoflaging code into ordinary "stain" patterns has been highly advanced by Dilstar7 and the Interplanetary Travel Advisors.</p>

        <p>DO NOT BE FOOLED. Every pattern is evidence. Every splatter is potentialy a communication from the Interplanetary Travel Advisors. The_Notorious_Pooh-Face attempts to intercept a powerful communication from the IPA (Interplanetary Travel Advisors) but as readers will learn in upcoming blogs, this attempt to halt intervention will prove unsuccessful.</p>
